A curated directory of externally maintained Agent Skills, skill collections, and supporting tools for AI-agent workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a links-only directory. Skills stay in their source repositories. Listing pull requests must not add `SKILL.md`, scripts, copied skill folders, or platform-specific indexes to this repository.

## Scope

This directory includes:

- **Agent Skills** — directly usable, reusable instruction packages with a public implementation.
- **Skill Collections** — repositories containing multiple usable Agent Skills.
- **Tooling & Integrations** — plugins, CLIs, MCP integrations, and related projects built for agent workflows.

This repository is not a package registry, a host for community skill files, a security audit, or an endorsement of the linked projects. Each entry remains maintained and licensed by its upstream owner.

## Using a Listed Project

1. Open the linked canonical source and read its current documentation.
2. Review its `SKILL.md`, scripts, dependencies, requested permissions, and external services before use.
3. Follow the upstream installation instructions for your agent platform.
4. Confirm that its license, platform support, data handling, and security assumptions fit your environment.

Compatibility and availability can change; the upstream repository is the source of truth.

## Contributing

For a normal listing pull request:

1. Add or update one upstream project in the appropriate section.
2. Edit **both** `README.md` and `README_ZH.md`, keeping the name, URL, type, and platform metadata in sync.
3. Change only those two files; do not vendor the upstream skill into this repository.

Entry format:

```markdown
- [Project name](canonical public source) — One concise, factual description. `Type: Skill` · `Platforms: Cross-platform`
```

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for eligibility, ordering, disclosure, pull-request scope, and commit-signing requirements.
